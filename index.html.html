    <h2>Quotes from The Machine Stops: </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>"The Machine," they exclaimed, "feeds us and clothes us and houses us; through it we speak to one another, 
			through it we see one another, in it we have our being. The Machine is the friend of ideas and the enemy of
			superstition: the Machine is omnipotent, eternal; blessed is the Machine."</li>
			  <li>Time passed, and they resented the defects no longer. The defects had not been remedied, but the human tissues in that latter
		day had become so subservient, that they readily adapted themselves to every caprice of the Machine.                </li>
        <li>No one confessed the Machine was out of hand. Year by year it was served with increased efficiency and decreased intelligence.            </li>
      
		<li>Things went from bad to worse unchallenged.</li>
